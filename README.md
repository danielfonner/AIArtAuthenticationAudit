# AIArtAuthenticationAudit
This repository contains the code to replicate the algorithm audit conducted in _The Necessity of Algorithm Auditing for AI Art Authenication Accountability_ (currently in pre-print form).

The 2 notebooks in this repository:
 1) gather and clean relevant data from WikiArt, and
 2) run the image resolution experiment on Cezanne's _Boy in a Red Vest_ and the _Elimar Van Gogh_.

Information is provided in both notebooks on any adjustments needed to look at different paintings.
